    **Steps for Free and Reduced Price Meals Data**



1. First download the data from the [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filessp.asp). Use the most recently available data from the 2021-2022 school year.
2. Import the data into a Google Sheet
3. Go to the tab that says, “FRPM School-Level Data.” It should look like this screenshot linked [here](https://github.com/Richard-Tzul/J296/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-01%20at%201.02.46%20PM.png).
4. The data covers all the districts in the state. We only want to look at 11 specific schools within the Oakland Unified School District. Select the District Name column. Then go to “Data” on the top bar and select “Create a filter.” Click on the filter button to the right and above the column name. Select “Clear” which is in blue. Then set the filter to “Oakland Unified.” Now the data set only shows OUSD schools. See screenshot linked [here](https://github.com/Richard-Tzul/J296/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-01%20at%201.36.41%20PM.png).
5. Create a fresh new tab. And call this new tab, “OUSD affected schools.” 
6. While there’s still a lot of schools listed in the “FRPM School-Level Data,” finding the affected schools should be quick since the listing is already alphabetical. Go to each affected school, copy the row of data and paste it into the new tab. Screenshot linked [here](https://github.com/Richard-Tzul/J296/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-01%20at%202.13.07%20PM.png).
7. On the “OUSD affected schools” tab, all the data needed is now there. 

**5 questions and answers about my datasets**



1. Are a majority of these students eligible for free or reduced meal plans?
    1. Yes with the exception of Hillcrest
2. Are the majority of these students Black and brown?
    2. Yes. Though about half of Hillcrest’s student population is white
3. Has enrollment declined at these schools?
    3. It has for most of them. Exceptions are Hillcrest and La Escuelita when comparing the 2016-2017 school year with the 2020-2021 school year.
4. How many of these schools have a majority of Black students?
    4. At four closing schools, over half of their student population is Black. While a similar question to ask as #1 it’s worth looking at these more specific numbers because the ACLU has filed a complaint against OUSD with the state department of justice, alleging that the closures discriminate against Black students
5. Is there a significant number of disabled students affected by these closures?
    5. Nearly a quarter of Brookfield Village’s student population is disabled, while a third of Grass Valley students are disabled. Six other affected schools have at least 10% disabled students out of their overall population.

**Article**

For my article I will pull some analysis and reporting from another article I wrote for a different class:

The Oakland Unified School District has slated seven schools for closure while four others will either merge or be downsized. The district said it’s closing schools due to declining enrollment and funding. The plans ignited community unrest among teachers, parents and students who are pleading to keep the schools open.

While the closures would have repercussions for parents and school employees, the ones who most bore the brunt are the students, who are overwhelmingly Black and brown. The ACLU has filed a complaint to the state’s Department of Justice, alleging racial discrimination toward Black students. At four closing schools, over half of their student population is Black, while less than 25% of the district’s overall student population is Black.

In spite of the public pressure they’ve faced in the last few months, the district board has held its ground and plans to proceed with its closures. (Although they have reduced the original number of closures amid public outcry.)

Two schools will be closed at the end of this school year: Community Day School and Parker K-8. The schools to be closed next year are Carl Munck Elementary, Korematsu Discovery Academy, Grass Valley Elementary, Brookfield Elementary and Horace Mann Elementary.

La Escuelita, and Hillcrest K-8 will be downsized; while Rise Community Elementary and New Highland Academy will merge.

The majority of affected schools have a population of at least 80% socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The only two exceptions are Hillcrest which has a low percentage of about 9% and Munck at 67%.

Socioeconomic chart linked [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Jz2Zp/1/)

While declining enrollment has been a chief justification for these closures, enrollment has ticked up in a couple of schools. 

Hillcrest had 394 students enrolled in the 2020-2021 school year compared to 377 in the 2016-2017 school year; albeit its 2020-2021 enrollment is a dip from the previous school year which was 400. La Escuelita experienced declining enrollment from the 2017-2018 to 2019-2020 school year but had an increase in the 2020-2021 school year. In the 2020-2021 school year, enrollment was at 408 compared to 2016-2017’s school year of 404.

Nearly a quarter of Brookfield Village’s student population is disabled, while a third of Grass Valley students are disabled. Six other affected schools have at least 10% disabled students out of their overall population.

All schools with the exception of Hillcrest have a majority student population that are eligible for free or reduced free meal plans. At least 90 percent of the student populations at Horace, Brookfield, Korematsu, Parker, La Escuelita, Rise Community and New Highland Academy are qualified for reduced price or free school meals. 100% of Community Day’s students are eligible for free or reduced meals.

That means nearly the entire student population at 8 out of the 11 schools are eligible for free or reduce meals.
