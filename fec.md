1. The tobacco and the media/entertainment industries gave the most to the Republican and Democratic parties respectively. The tobacco industry gave $2,870,000 while the media/entertinament industry gave $1,880,000.
I created a pivot table with industries in rows, parties in columns and donation amount in values (as sum). I then copied and pasted the table into another tab/sheet then sorted each column by amount to indentify who spent the most and to whom.
2. The Misc. Business sector contributed $3,520,000 to the Dems. I created a pivot table, put sector in rows, amount in values, and parties in columns.
There are 4 donors based in Miami Lakes, FL. I created a pivot table, put city in rows, state in columns, donor in values using CountA.
3. Philip Morris accounted for nearly 4% of donations to the toabcco industry. In a pivot table, I put donors in rows, industry in columns, and amount in values while using percentage of grand total to list them. Morris donated a total of $2,070,00. I found this by simply changing the values to be listed as default instead of percentage of grand total.
4. # The Wealthy Man Funding Big Tobacco
     I would do an inside look behind Philip Morris. Why is he funding so much money into big tobacco? Is he a tobacco executitve? How influential has he been in lobbying and legislation? I would interview experts in public health and economics for an expertise look at Big tobacco. I would also try to interview Mr. Morris himself.
5. This is data for donations/contributions. I would join this data with lobbying data in order to do the aforemention story. Another dataset that could be useful for my story is big tobacoo stocks and other financial data, to see how it correlates with lobbying and donations.
